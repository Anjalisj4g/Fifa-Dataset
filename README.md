In this session, I will use various methods of exploratory data analysis to examine the characteristics of the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset.
This dataset contain 18207 rows and 89 columns. Using the dataset, I tried to give some insights on the nationality of players and their clubs, 
their physique and their playing styles.
I have imported pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualisation.
I have visualised the countries with most number of players using bar graph.

The salary range of players are visualised using histogram.

Some of the insights fetched from the exploratory data analysis is given below :
* Country with the most number of players is England


The bar chart indicates that significantly higher number of players prefer right foot. Only a very few players prefer left foot.
